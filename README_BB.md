## Introduction

Welcome to Beginners Bytes, the idea behind this website/blog is to have a comprehensive online platform designed to help newcomers to the world of coding get started with the fundamentals of web development. The website offers a range of interactive tutorials, guides, and resources to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django from scratch. With a focus on simplicity and clarity, Beginner Bytes breaks down complex concepts into bite-sized chunks, making it easy for beginners to grasp and build upon their skills. Whether you're looking to create a personal website, build a web application, or simply understand how the web works, Beginner Bytes provides a supportive and engaging environment to learn and grow. With its step-by-step approach, interactive coding exercises, and real-world examples, Beginner Bytes is the perfect resource for anyone looking to take their first steps in coding and web development.

The website was created during Hackathon 3, dated from 15/08/24 - 19/08/24. 

Goals for this hackathon was to show off our skills we've learnt to produce a full stack development project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django as a team. 


## Agile

## Project Boards

Using Agile, the project was designed with the minimum viable product (MVP) in mind. With this being said we went for a simplistic approach making sure we have full functionality before any features were added.

Must do's: 

- Login and registration (authentication) for users of the blog to sign into their accounts. 
- Simple and effortless navigation around the site.
- A screen for comments to be added, edited or deleted.

Should do: 

- Allow authenticated users the ability to comment on blog posts 

Won't do: 

- Email/reset password login details as this would require an email server and is beyond the scope of this project.
- Multiple blog pages and a search bar for users to find specific articles only due to time constraints and we want to just show the basic functionality for now. 

We used the project board in Github to stay organised and on top of the project by creating tasks and user stories.
